## Bugs

Not the epitome of good coding practices since this was my first Swift & macOS app ever, may break in exciting ways at the slightest excuse.

- doesn't tell you if the signal is lost
- shrugs at stale data
- doesn't bother with error handling

## Errata

I found out about the data stream from https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/, which has considerably more and more interesting stats than just how full the piss tank is. 

I will not be adding any of them.
